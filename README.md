**Close tab by double right clicking anywhere on the page. Inspired by "Rights To Close" legacy extension for Mozilla Firefox.**

**Open source:**

**This extension is available for:**
* Google Chrome
* Mozilla Firefox

**Created by:**
* Priyank Parashar

**Notes:**

* To enable this extension in "incognito" window mode or for "file:///" URLs, you will need to provide permissions for this by going to "chrome://extensions".

* Close Tab by Double Right Click implements an alternative approach for closing "chrome:///", "about:blank" and other special tabs. This is due to technical limitations of Chrome API. In these tabs, you would find a "Close Tab" context-menu entry which is shown when you right click anywhere on the page.

**Inspirations:**
* The idea of this extension is inspired by "Rights To Close" legacy extension for Mozilla Firefox.
